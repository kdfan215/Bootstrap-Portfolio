          My name is Ryan Braudo and I am 23 years old. I graduated from
          California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo with a B.S.
          in Business Administration June 2018. After graduating I decided I
          wanted to work in the hospitality industry. Apparently, the industry
          only wants people with experience for entry-level jobs. I love dogs
          and ended up getting a job at a doggie hotel and worked there for six
          months. I enjoyed it but the pay was horrendous so it did not work
          out. I applied for other hospitality jobs for the last 6 months
          unsuccessfully. That is how I ended up here! I wanted to learn an
          in-demand skill that will help me no matter the industry. In my spare
          time I watch NBA basketball. My favorite player is Kevin Durant and my
          favorite team is the Lakers. I love playing videogames especially
          Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption 2. I have two dogs named
          Bentley and Roscoe. They are good boys. Usually.
